# Pok√©dex App

### Instructions for running:


1. Clone the repository
   `git clone https://github.com/lindsey-doyle/PokedexApp`
   and enter the project directory
   `cd PokedexApp`

3. Install dependencies: 
   `npm install`

4. Run the app: 
   `npm start`

   The easiest way to run this project without installing and setting up additional software (Xcode / Android studio) is via the Expo Go app. Download the app on your iPhone or Android, and connect your phone to the same wifi network.

   When you run the `npm start` command, you should see a QR code appear and some useful command hints.

   Press the 's' key to switch to using Expo Go (rather than the development server), and follow the instructions to scan the QR code and open the project in the Expo Go app on your phone. 

   This should load the project on your device to use and play with within the Expo Go app.

5. To stop the project, press `ctrl + c`
